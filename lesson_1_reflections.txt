How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I was able to spot the bug in a fraction of the time than if I had to look
through the entire contents of the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could spot common errors and work to minimize those types of errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: Control over when code gets updated.
Cons: 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Projects may contain large amount of files and having to save each one 
individually can be time consuming, so saving multiple files is more time
efficietn. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Version control provides an easy way to revert to a working version of the code. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Develop Android and iOS apps.
